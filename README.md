# FUTA-Cpp-Practical-Coursework
## Description:
A collection of C++ coursework covering core programming concepts:  
- **Array operations** (sorting, searching, dynamic arrays)  
- **Pointer mechanics** (memory management, dereferencing, pointer arithmetic)  
- **Structure implementations** (user-defined types, data organization)  
- **Procedural programming** (functions, modular design, control flow)  
- **OOP principles** (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation)  

Includes lab assignments, projects, and demonstrations of key C++ features. Ideal for learners and reviewers of foundational C++ syntax and paradigms.  

### Key Features:
1. **Clear Scope:** Lists specific topics without jargon.  
2. **SEO-Friendly:** Uses terms like "OOP" and "pointer mechanics" for discoverability.  
3. **Practical Utility:** Highlights "lab assignments" and "demonstrations" to signal hands-on content.
